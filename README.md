## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The thing that tooke me more time and effort to do was the image and the purple color on it. The solution was very simple. I use this code for all the section:

```css
.image-container .image {
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 247px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    hsla(277, 79%, 38%, 0.5), 
    hsl(277, 79%, 38%, 0.5)
  ), url("../images/image-header-mobile.jpg");
}
```
The height stays at 0 no matter what, so i use the propety max-height to declare it. For the color i use the image as the background of the container an use a linear gradient which is not a gradient but it works as expected.
